    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that enables the organization and structuring of code around objects, which are instances of classes. OOP aims to promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code by encapsulating data and behavior within objects.\n",
    "The key objectives of OOP can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: OOP helps organize code by grouping related data and behaviors into objects.Encapsulation allows for data hiding and protection, ensuring that the internal representation and implementation details of an object are hidden from outside access. This promotes security and maintains the integrity of the data. For example, if we were creating a program for a car, we could have a \"Car\" object that holds information about the car's color, model, and speed, as well as actions like starting the engine or stopping the car. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: With OOP, we can create objects that inherit properties and behaviors from other objects. This means we can make a new object based on an existing one, saving time and effort. For instance, we could create a \"Truck\" object that inherits the properties and behaviors of a \"Vehicle\" object, and then add some truck-specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: OOP allows us to treat different objects in a similar way, as long as they share common characteristics. This is called polymorphism. For example, we can have a \"Shape\" object and different objects like \"Circle,\" \"Square,\" and \"Triangle\" that inherit from it. We can then write code that works with any shape object without worrying about its specific type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: OOP lets us hide the inner workings of an object and only expose what's necessary. This is called encapsulation. For example, if we have a \"BankAccount\" object, we can hide the details of how the account balance is calculated or how transactions are processed, making the code more secure and easier to understand.\n",
